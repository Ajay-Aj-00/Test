* For this We have to make the user==admin through the given cookie.
> The Vulnerability here is The Encrytion is Providing the IV as cookie[:16] , So if we change the cookie[:16] part which will leads to **XOR** with Second part and changes the Corresponding Indexs
* This is [AES CBC bit flipping attack](https://masterpessimistaa.wordpress.com/2017/05/03/cbc-bit-flipping-attack/)
> ck = encrypted message<br>
> Let ck[20] is 'A' and we want ck[20] as 'a'.Corresponding Index for 20 in First part is 4.<br>
> **ck[4]=ck[4]^'A'^'a'**<br>
> After decrypting ck. It leads to `ck[20] as 'a'` But The First Part ck[16] will change.<br>
> It wont rise a problem because it's a garbage String.<br>
